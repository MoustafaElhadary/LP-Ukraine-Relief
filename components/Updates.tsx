      More good news to report today:  we now have a total of seven safe and secure after their recent arrival in Katowice, Poland.  Three of them‚ÄîMaryna, Tania and  Katia got some food, a shower and a good night‚Äôs sleep at Ola‚Äôs house  after their >48 hours in transit, and this morning all headed right back to the border to welcome and to help the many other refugees who have also made the journey üí™üí™üí™.

      Some more folks are being driven to the border through a coordinated effort of LP colleagues and our many wonderful connections in Hungary and elsewhere in Europe. We are so fortunate to have all of you in our lives!

      <p className="text-base">
      Also we are happy to report that we have reached our initial goal of $550,000 to support our colleagues in Ukraine.  Isn‚Äôt that awesome?!  Nearly 200 donations from around the LP world, from friends, family, customers, employees, vendors‚Ä¶Amazing!  Donations in any amount are still welcome, and very much appreciated as, sadly, there will be more help required over time for sure.

      Your emails of support and encouragement have been wonderful to read. We hope to bring you more good news tomorrow.

      We are overwhelmed by the outpouring of support for our Ukraine team! Thank you to all of you all over the world who have offered money, accommodations and prayers.

      Three of the girls are in line at the Polish border,

      will be met by Pawel and Ola and taken to Ola‚Äôs family‚Äôs
      home. Once they are settled, they will move into an
      apartment where they will have food and other necessary
      items. Thank you again to our Poland team for their
      24/7support!
